### Data Flow

1. Claude Code sessions produce JSONL transcripts in `~/.claude/projects/`
2. `summarize.py` aggregates 7 days of transcripts → `~/.claude/tool-time/stats.json`
3. `/tool-time` skill triggers summarize + upload
4. `upload.py` reads stats.json, anonymizes it, POSTs to `/v1/api/submit`
5. Worker stores in D1, dashboard reads from `/v1/api/stats`

### Ecosystem Data

- **Skills**: Extracted from `tool_use` events with `skill` field in input
- **MCP servers**: Parsed from tool names matching `mcp__<server>__<tool>`
- **Installed plugins**: Read from `~/.claude/settings.json` → `enabledPlugins`

## API Endpoints

### Public

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/v1/api/submit` | Submit anonymized stats |
| GET | `/v1/api/stats` | Aggregated community stats (7-day window) |
| DELETE | `/v1/api/user/:token` | GDPR data deletion |

### Admin (requires `Authorization: Bearer <ADMIN_TOKEN>`)

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | `/v1/api/admin/submissions` | List recent submissions (accepts `?limit=N`, max 200) |
| DELETE | `/v1/api/admin/submissions/:id` | Delete a submission by ID (cascades to all related stats) |

## Database (Cloudflare D1)

Tables:
- `submissions` — one row per upload (keyed by submission_token + generated_at)
- `tool_stats` — per-tool calls/errors/rejections (FK → submissions, CASCADE delete)
- `skill_stats` — per-skill call counts (FK → submissions, CASCADE delete)
- `mcp_server_stats` — per-MCP-server calls/errors (FK → submissions, CASCADE delete)
- `plugin_usage_aggregate` — aggregate install counts (no submission linkage, for privacy)

Migrations are in `community/migrations/`. Apply with:
```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute tool-time-db --file=migrations/NNN_name.sql
```

## Development

### Local plugin testing
```bash
# Regenerate stats with local code (not cached plugin)
python3 summarize.py

# Run tests
uv run --with pytest pytest test_summarize.py test_upload.py -v
```

### Worker deployment
```bash
cd community
npm run deploy
```

Deploys also happen automatically on `git push` when `community/` files change (via git pre-push hook).

### Secrets

- `ADMIN_TOKEN` — stored as Cloudflare Worker secret (`wrangler secret put ADMIN_TOKEN`)
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` — in `~/.bashrc`, scoped to Workers

### Community sharing config

User config lives at `~/.claude/tool-time/config.json`:
```json
{"community_sharing": true, "submission_token": "<auto-generated>"}
```

## Known Issues

- Installed plugin cache may lag behind local code (plugin version bump needed for users to get new features)
- MCP server stats are empty for projects that don't use MCP tools (expected)
- `model` field in submissions is often null (depends on transcript metadata)

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd sync
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds
